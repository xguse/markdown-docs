#READ ME
## markdown-docs

This repository is meant to contain my writings for work/personal/otherwise that I intend to write in markdown.  Hopefully using [Markx] to allow me to have a fully functional academicly suitable writing environment that will also allow me to easily share with non-LaTeX minded collaborators.
