- by the time it gets to the sites its there because the job is one that needs too much experience or NO ONE WANTS TO DO THEM.



# Effective applications for a Career outside of Academia #

- summary/objectives/qualifications section:
    - test for quality of item:
        - can i paste this in to another person's application and have it make sense? _Its not ready_



# How to talk about yourself: Successful interviewing strategies #

- tell me about yourself:
    - one the only times you should write it all out

- looking for flaws:
    - no examples here...
    - tell truth
    - strengths lead to weaknesses
    - they have probably figured this out
    - keep it short 
    - use strength to explain weakness
        - "bc i am so flexible i have trouble managing time...."
    - include how you are over coming it


- why are you leaving academia:
    - don't spend time on the negative of academia but _the POSITIVE of industry_
    - talk about the things you are going toward

## During the interview ##

- what you say is very little of what you are communicating

__GIVE EXAMPLES FOR EVERY QUESTION__

- embed all answers in examples from your experience

- positive focus:
    - dont be overly cautious about your skills _when speaking to non-academics_
        - i am confident that in a couple hours i would be able to get up to speed on
- voice quality:
    - volume, tone enunciation and speed
    - nervous yields more of what you do naturally
- avoid fillers:
    - uh... like... umm...
- dont worry about silence:
    - take a bit to organize yourself
- avoid slang and informal language:
    - follow your interviewers lead (to an extent)
    - be polished version of self and interviewer
- relax:
    - dont sound too over rehearsed
    - canyt fake confidence but you SHOULD BE CONFIDENT

## non verbal communication ##

- physical appearance:
    - trying to look like something you're not can cause issues too
    - dont test out new non-YOU dress
- eye contact:
    - thumb: when listening look at them, maybe look around while YOU are talking
- hand shake:
    - firm 
    - __DRY__
- seated posture:
    - thumb: sit back with back against "back"

## adapt to interview ##

- pay attention to the first impression that they take from you
- interviewer focus:
    - prevention vs promotion
- attention to:
    - lips compressed (worried)
    - neck rub (uncomfortable)
    - eye rub (resistance)
    - shoulder raise (uncertainty)
- how are you making them feel:
- __LISTEN__

## Power poses ##

- look it up...
