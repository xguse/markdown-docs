# My planning #

- balancing _number of loci_ vs _depth of per loci coverage_:
    - what is my sequencing budget?
    - What is my question set?
    - Because _selection_ __AND__ _population genetics_ are part of the project needs, shooting for conditions that favor more loci with as high a sequencing coverage as we can afford is probably the best route.
- There are equations for choosing size selection cutoffs that take into account the above considerations associated with the protocols (she says)
- I have not seen the protocols yet

# Andrea's data #

- If I am to use her data in my questions:
    - I need to know exactly what she did in terms of size selection
        - _the size selection is how you target the same loci_
    - I need to determine whether the conditions she used are even _compatible_ with the questions __I__ want to ask.

# pyRAD #

- She likes/loves it compared to STACKS which was used before
- it is pretty comprehensive in its coverage of the entire analysis stack
- Daren is great and responsive
- I would like to volunteer to help in its development
