# Interest in Uganda #

- aside from pure academic curiosity, there are real public health reasons to do work here
- Convergence of the chronic and acute forms of Sleeping Sickness is imminent 
- Currently _G. f. fuscipes_ populations exist in semi-isolation due likely to water features
- Yet cases of the two forms of sickness, while rare indicate that at least the parasites are moving closer to a situation where diagnosis (already difficult) will become even harder.
- important because treatments are different for the two forms

## Some questions about the Convergence ##

- what can we expect from _G. f. fuscipes_ populations when they encounter the __other__ parasite-type?
- can we identify the corridors of gene-flow between
    - the sub populations
    - the larger north/south divide?
- how can we use this information to inform vector control strategies?
- how long has the north/south divide existed and what is/was the main cause



## Positives are in SHORT supply ##

- VERY SHORT

# Collection numbers #

## how many villages have we sampled in 2014? ##

- 47

## total files collected ##

- 6867

## total flies dissected and assessed for infection of any Tryps ##

- 3699

## positives ##


- __total:__ 85 
- __positive rate (overall):__ 2.3%
- __positive rates in best villages:__

# Methods #

- past has focused on MicroSat
    - less DNA needed

- moving to ddRAD for more SNPs


# Collection protocol #

- created and distributed 
- to help standardize problems with curration


# Database/sample tracking efforts #

- you know this
