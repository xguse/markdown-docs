# Prof at Macarere #

- Anyare?
- extra flies but with poor records

# to recovery #

- namatumba yes
- buvuma no
  
# Hydrating EtOH flies #

- SerapA introduce to person to give us method

# Best time to collect #

- rains coming in MArch predicted
- bush burning leaves only young flies for a while
    - so wait for May-ish

# Strategy for coming season #

- sample around many places in north west
- note the positive areas
- focus on productive areas

# _G. f. fuscipes_ Crosses #

- ElizabethO has experience
- best to get PURE north to PURE south
- maybe move pupae
- first mate to selves (control)
- SerapA to ask Loyce to send ~10 cages
  
# Short challenge _G. f. fuscipes_ with Tryps #

- SerapA: offers to come out and bring personnel
- SerapA: best way is work with live flies from field
- ElizabethO: transporting male/female together cause much death
- SerapA: keep relatively YOUNG (wing fray ~(1-3?))
- RichardE: may be some permitting needed
    - needs working out
    - may need full protocol submission
    - SerapA: knows someone is/has doing/done this type of thing (I didnt get the name)
    - SerapA: notes this is not looking for mature infection
- Need Tryps (tbr, tbg)
    - SerapA: suggests RichardE may ask for help from someone he knows

# RobertOs work #

- do 20 sites for now
- flesh out if other regions need to be concentrated on

# Another Student #

- Gulu problem: losing people after degree
- Jocelyn suggested: RichardE worries about Loyce and the complicated relationship
- subject of PatrickA: not enthusiastic response
  
# Workshop in Gulu over next year or so #

- original problem was lab space but now RichardE has space
- funding is issues
    - funds written on paper but never arrive
- SerapA: suggest do it when RobertO gets back (next year)
- RichardE: challenge of bringing in folks from outside Uganda on 10,000 is tough
    - SerapA: outside is best but local is fine
    - folks tend to agree
    - We could go out for field trip and stay for some instruction
- SerapA: mentioned keeping RobertO here for maybe another three months?
- ElizabethO: good number for training?
    - GisellaC: 10 to 15
