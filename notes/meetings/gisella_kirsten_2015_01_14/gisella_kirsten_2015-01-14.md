# Discussed #

## Changes to screen procedures  ##

- pooling rxns abandoned for individual PCR
- gels run as pools instead
- this is probably best since even with individuals, the sensitivity is not great
- added additional PCR rxn using product of first as template to increase sensitivity

## Results ##

- 2 plates tested (~200 individuals)
- Plate 1:
    - __Village:__ AKA
    - __Results:__ 3 positives detected
- Plate 2:
    - __Village:__ Mix of the high infection villages
    - __Results:__ 1 positive detected

## Robert's Work ##

- will be focused on MicroSats
- should only need legs as genetic material
- will use the Zygem (spelling?) DNA extraction kit
- some talk about stability of DNA from this kit but will use it anyway and test quality when Robert begins work 


## Undergrad ##

- will work on extracting DNA for Robert's MicroSat work ahead of his arrival
- Kirstin will train
- Needs to be briefed on over-all project for a talk she must give
- Gisella will have her apply for the small Alumni grant


# Current/future plans #

## Dead positives screen ##

- Plate 3:
    - __Village:__ ? not sure. Will check.
    - __Status:__ waiting for extraction?
- Plate 4:
    - __Village:__ Mostly ACA
    - __Status:__ needs ~15 more dissections
- Pick out deads from the "most infected" areas of the _Spring 2014_ data for next round of screens.


## Robert's stuff ##

- Pick out 26 flies (13 M, 13 F) from each area we want to look at for Robert's work in March
- make sure we have an updated map with all the villages from _Spring and Summer 2014_
- Meet with Gisella to pick out which locations Robert's data will come from while looking at the updated map.
