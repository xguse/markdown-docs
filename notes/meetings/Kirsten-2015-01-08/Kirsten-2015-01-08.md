# Discussed #

## Change in pooling ##

- Pooling was abandoned for the reaction and moved to the gel/detection stage
- PCR done on individuals
- pooled PCR results run on gel for examination
- This is probably good as Serap mentioned she did not like the pooled idea bc of low DNA abundance

## Results ##

- 2 plates tested (~200 individuals)
- Plate 1:
    - __Village:__ AKA
    - __Results:__ no positives detected
- Plate 2:
    - __Village:__ Mix of the high infection villages
    - __Results:__ no positives detected

## Observations ##

- Control rxns with __FLY__ primers show expected results
- In control rxn with 100 ng of DNA extracted from known positive flies, she __still__ can barely see the band when using the __TRYP__ primers
- It is possible that some __false negatives__ exist in these data
- Further supports abandoning the pooled PCR rxns for individual rxns

# Current/future plans #

- she plans to repeat at least a subset of the rxns using the first rxn as template
- I feel that it would be interesting to see the results of this but fear that it may introduce __false positives__ if not confirmed with more stringent conditions.
- such confirmation however is cheap in both time and cost so I think its definitely worth doing.
- more plates are on deck for screening as well

## Estimated time to completion ##

- two weeks depending on facility load
