# Discussed #

- Methods
    - need to be collated into one doc
- Status of LD analysis and how to choose cut-off
    - look at tryp paper and email Mark regarding this
- Status of hapFLK (haplotype analysis) and state of results
    - email to author is sent and waiting for response
    - contacting Noonan and/or Jeff Townsend regarding this
- Structure of paper
    1. Development of the base SNP set
        - a process I am not clear on at the moment
    1. Linkage Analysis
    1. Functional Annotation of filtered SNPs
    1. Discussion
        - establish the ability to do this scale of work in _G. f. fuscipes_
        - limits of the dataset as it now stands
        - Never-the-less, hypotheses can be formulated and here they are...


# Current/future plans #

__Gisella:__

- `[X]` email Washington group about methods of Seq prep and analysis
- `[X]` email Aksoy group about linkage status of _G. m. morsitans_

__Andrea:__

- `[ ]` Re-run RAD pipeline showing Gus whats going on and writing up the pieces.
- `[X]` Contact Noonan and/or Townsend regarding `hapFLK` stuff

__Gus:__

- `[X]` email Mark about Tryp LD analysis in his paper
- `[ ]` read Tryp paper for same
- `[ ]` install latest `Stacks` version on `louise` and make runable by Andrea
- `[ ]` return `hapFLK` script to original code and copy altered version to new name
- `[ ]` Generate descriptive statistics and figures of the LD results as a whole rather than by contig where possible
- `[ ]` upon decision of which near-by genes are "interesting" send summary of info known about them to Aksoy group for ideas.
