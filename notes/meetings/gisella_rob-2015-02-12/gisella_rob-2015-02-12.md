# Overview of discussed #

## Message to Eliot ##

- email asking about:
    - GEO COORDINATES for ambiguous location names
        - include pictures of samples/boxes
    - Samples/boxes listed on the PDF manifest but missing once shipment received
- Drafted by __[Rob]__ and sent to Gisella
- Passed on to destination by __[Gisella]__


## Sample catalog summaries ##

### Next iteration ###

- data types:
    - location
    - symbols when present (_I assume you mean location symbol?_)
    - number of individuals
    - date range
    - is tissue?
    - is extraction?
    - analysis status
- will be done in `python` for increased flexibility by __[Gus]__

### Cold-room/freezer samples ###

- __Important Note:__ extracted samples from freezer are sourced from cold-room tissues
- read Johnson Ouma paper for:
    - protocol starting points
    - MicroSats
    - mDNA
- First Steps for __[Rob]__:
    - shadow Kirsten to learn extractions
    - take 5 samples with legs for extraction
    - test extractions with PCR:
        - ITS if available or can use _G. f. fuscipes_ primers
            - find out if this will work
        - MicroSat primers from Ouma paper or otherwise __[being obtained by Kirstin]__


### Nonsensical/ambiguous location names ###

- __[Rob]__ will locate and bring to __[Gisella]__ for help


## Questions for Gisella ##

### Which extraction kit for legs? ###

- Same as for midguts
- Kirstin is trouble shooting it currently for legs
