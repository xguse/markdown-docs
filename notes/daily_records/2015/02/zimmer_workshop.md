## reflexions on assignments ##

- __frank:__ be willing to "kill your darlings"
    - drop things that arent working even if you LOVE it
- __other:__ felt she repeated her self bc of the structure (intro up front stuff)
    - dont give away too many details in the intro
    - hard to find what will grab the reader but not __NEED__ context to understand (so you dont have to get into the meat __twice__)
    - tap into reader's existing curiousity/intrest __not__ existing expertise (cause that == __ZERO__)
- make sure you are not writing more than one story at once
- what happens when the paper you choose has like 6 cool results and maybe a great method too
    - consider your assignment length
    - whats the __main__ thing you think is interesting or the audience might
    - include caveats when needed that show there is more to the paper than what you are covering
    - its ok to leave somethings unexhausted



## Life as a public scientist ##

- Brian Greene as example
- remmeber that this was the case back in the day

## When reporters show up ##

- need to think about what you are going to say before the phone rings
- might feel like minimizing all contact (PhD comics example of sci-news cycle)
- problem is that this cycle will happen without you and you dont get to influence it if you dont participate
- most important steps are at the beginning
    - PRESS release (be obnoxious if its not something you can stand behind)
        - use the fact that its your name on the line
    - reporters
        - be ready with what you want the reporter to leave with
        - think about that 600 word version of your paper and base the convo on that
