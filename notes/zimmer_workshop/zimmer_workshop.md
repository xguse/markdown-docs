- when reporter calls
- how to break into the biz
- what IS the biz
- self published scientist
- more

## reflexions on assignments ##

- __frank:__ be willing to "kill your darlings"
    - drop things that arent working even if you LOVE it
- __other:__ felt she repeated her self bc of the structure (intro up front stuff)
    - dont give away too many details in the intro
    - hard to find what will grab the reader but not __NEED__ context to understand (so you dont have to get into the meat __twice__)
    - tap into reader's existing curiousity/intrest __not__ existing expertise (cause that == __ZERO__)
- make sure you are not writing more than one story at once
- what happens when the paper you choose has like 6 cool results and maybe a great method too
    - consider your assignment length
    - whats the __main__ thing you think is interesting or the audience might
    - include caveats when needed that show there is more to the paper than what you are covering
    - its ok to leave somethings unexhausted



## Life as a public scientist ##

- Brian Greene as example
- remmeber that this was the case back in the day

## When reporters show up ##

- need to think about what you are going to say before the phone rings
- might feel like minimizing all contact (PhD comics example of sci-news cycle)
- problem is that this cycle will happen without you and you dont get to influence it if you dont participate
- most important steps are at the beginning
    - PRESS release (be obnoxious if its not something you can stand behind)
        - use the fact that its your name on the line
    - reporters
        - be ready with what you want the reporter to leave with
        - think about that 600 word version of your paper and base the convo on that

    - christie wilcox
    - internet is main source of scientific information on specific issues

- A mesh not a pipeline:

## Questions ##

### about long vs short form ##

- Carl does not think that the shortification is a long term issue
- the Atlantic
- the Adivist(?)
    - 20K words
    - too long for mag
    - too short for book

### Places tio write sometimes but not your own second job like Blog ##

- op/ed
- but in order to get published even by these people you need to practice this skill, maybe a lot
- so why not blog it?

### Advice for writing Journal articles that Carl would like to read ###

- __important:__ lay out problem in the beginning in very clear way
    - abandon the right amount of expertise 
    - remember that _hopefully_ journalist may also be reading
- you can sort of diagnose problems likely to be in the rest pf the paper by the quality of the introduction
- discussion:
    - reader should understand __why__ one paragraph follows the last
    - even -- __especially__ -- a non-specialist should be able to
