# Deploying Traps #

## Materials ##
- gum boots

### Per Trap ###
- 1 metal rod
- 1 biconical fabric trap
- 1 collection cage and net sleeve
- thick grease
- ~2 rubber bands

## Team ##
Deployment teams generally consist of 2 to 5 people.
Gear is divided among the team as works best but there are usually a couple common classes of job.

Record Keeper

:	carries the GPS device, a pencil, a pad of paper.

Panga

:	Carries the panga and hammer.

General Purpose

:	carries what is needed. Some combination of trap materials as needed including trap cones, collection cages/nets, grease, rubber bands.

## Procedures ##
- As the team travels in the deployment area conducive sites are identified.
- The __Record Keeper__ places the date and trap number into the collection cage; records the trap's GPS coordinates __in DECIMAL DEGREES__ format to 5 decimal places; and makes notes about the type of surrounding habitat as well as human activity in sight of the trap.
- The site is cleared by the __Panga__ and the rod is driven into the ground deep enough to provide robust "staying power".
- The fabric cone is sliped onto the rod and the bottom is secured with a rubber band.
- the tagged cage is added to the top and secured with a rubber band.
- a __generous__ amount of thick grease is applied to the rod below the cone such that the safari ants will be denied access to the trap cone and collection cage.

# Processing Flies #

## Materials ##

## Procedures ##

The fly processing is handled in an assembly-line format with stations responsible for specific parts of the task.



### Trap extraction ###
The first station is responsible for removing the flies from the cage of the current trap and recording the initial information for this fly in the field collection sheet^[To obtain the sheets that we used in the field you will need to contact Richard Echodu,  but the excel file templates we sent should give an idea of what is included.]
This information includes (but may not be limited to):

- trap number
- the fly number
- sex
- hunger stage and or wing fray
- collection date
- town name/ID symbol

Generally this station incapacitates the fly by cracking its head or some other way of killing the fly without causing too much physical destruction to the fly.
Finally, this station places the fly on a microscope slide with a frosted labeling end, writes the number corresponding to this fly in the field sheet on the slide, and lines the slide up in front of the __Dissection__ station.

_Inputs:_

- Retrieved trap cages

_Outputs:_

- to the field record sheets and __Labeling__:
	- fly information
- to __Dissection__:
	- slide with incapacitated fly and labeled with fly number
- to __Packaging__ (delayed):
	- flies that were dead before collection/processing sorted into
		1. Juveniles (combined sexes)
		2. Males
		3. Females


### Labeling ###
This station does not strictly "follow" the assembly-line but is more of a concurrent station with the __Trap extraction__ station.
The __Labeling__ station writes the relevant information for each fly as it is being removed from the trap and incapacitated in preparation for dissection.
The information is recorded in pencil on a pad of small labels that will be placed on each tube that contains part of the fly with the corresponding number (Figure XX).
The important information recorded is:

- Location code
- date (MM-DD)
- Fly number
- Trap number
- Tissue code

Periodically, the labels are handed to the __Packaging__ station(s) for application to the tubes.

_Inputs:_

- Fly information from the field recording sheets

_Outputs:_

- to __Packaging__:
	- tube labels

### Dissection ###

_Inputs:_

- slides with incapacitated fly and labeled with fly number

_Outputs:_

- to __Infection detection__:
	- labeled slides with dissected fly and tissues 


### Infection detection ###

_Inputs:_

- labeled slides with dissected fly and tissues 

_Outputs:_

- to __Packaging__:
	- labeled slides with dissected fly and tissues
	- infection status
