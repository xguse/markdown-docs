# Deploying Traps #

## Materials ##
- Gum boots
- GPS device
- Panga
- Mallet/hammer
- Pencil(s)
- razor (keeping pencil(s) sharp)
- Paper for notes and trap-labels
- Trap materials (see below)

### Per Trap ###
- 1 metal rod (~2 meters long)
- 1 biconical fabric trap
- 1 collection cage and net sleeve 
- thick grease
- ~2 rubber bands

## Team ##
Deployment teams generally consist of 2 to 5 people.
Gear is divided among the team as works best but there are usually a few common classes of roles.

Record Keeper

:	carries the GPS device, a pencil, a pad of paper.

Panga

:	carries the panga and hammer.

General Purpose

:	carries what is needed. Some combination of trap materials as needed including trap cones, collection cages/nets, grease, rubber bands.

## Procedures ##
- As the team travels in the deployment area conducive sites are identified.
- The __Record Keeper__ places the date and trap number into the collection cage; records the trap's GPS coordinates __in DECIMAL DEGREES__ format to 5 decimal places; and makes notes about the type of surrounding habitat as well as human activity in sight of the trap.
- The site is cleared by the __Panga__ and the rod is driven into the ground deep enough to provide robust "staying power".
- The fabric cone is slipped onto the rod and the bottom is secured with a rubber band.
- the tagged cage is added to the top and secured with a rubber band.
- a __generous__ amount of thick grease is applied to the rod below the cone such that the safari ants will be denied access to the trap cone and collection cage.

![Labels typical of what is used at the __Label maker__ station. \label{fig:labels} ](figures/label_pad.jpg)


## Procedures ##

The fly processing is handled in an assembly-line format with stations responsible for specific parts of the task (Figure \ref{fig:flow}).

![Basic Processing Flow -- Grey boxes are processing stations. White rounded boxes are inputs/outputs of processing stations. Arrows show the flow of processing materials. BOLD arrows show the flow of fly materials. The green box represents materials set aside for processing after the live flies have been processed. \label{fig:flow} ](figures/fly_processing_flow.pdf)


###########################################################
### Trap extraction station ###

<!-- _Inputs:_

- Retrieved trap cages

_Outputs:_

- to the field record sheets and __Labeling__:
	- fly information
- to __Dissection__:
	- slide with incapacitated fly and labeled with fly number
- to __Packaging__ (delayed):
	- flies that were dead before collection/processing sorted into
		1. Juveniles (combined sexes)
		2. Males
		3. Females -->


This station is responsible for removing the flies from the cage of the current trap and recording the initial information for this fly in the field collection sheet^[To obtain the sheets that we used in the field you will need to contact Richard Echodu (richardechodu2009@gmail.com), but the excel file templates we sent should give an idea of what is included.].
This information includes (but may not be limited to):

- date (once per sheet)
- trap number
- the fly number
- sex
- hunger stage and/or wing fray
- collection date
- town name/ID symbol

_For each fly:_

1. Incapacitate fly by cracking its head or some other way of killing the fly without causing too much physical destruction to the fly.
1. Collect and record in the field record sheet the prescribed information (see above list).
1. Place fly on microscope slide with a frosted labeling end.
1. Write the number that corresponds to this fly in the field record sheet on the slide label with _pencil_.
1. Send slide to __Dissection__.


_Remarks:_

- __Don't get bitten__.
- __Close attention__ must be paid to ensure the number on the slide matches the number for each fly in the field record.
If _even __ONE___ numbered fly is mistakenly left out of the processing stream or an additional added to the stream it will cause __ALL SUBSEQUENT fly information__ to be incorrect^[Similar to a frame-shift mutation: it shifts the register of identities out of sync with all remaining flies.].


###########################################################
### Labeling station ###

<!-- _Inputs:_

- Fly information from the field recording sheets

_Outputs:_

- to __Packaging__:
	- tube labels -->


- This station does not strictly "follow" in the assembly-line but is more of a concurrent station with the __Trap extraction__ station.


- The __Labeling__ station writes the relevant information for each fly as it is being removed from the trap and incapacitated in preparation for dissection.
- The information is recorded in pencil on a pad of small labels that will be placed on each tube (by the __Packaging__ station) that contains part of the fly with the corresponding number (Figure \ref{fig:labels}).
- The important information to be recorded is:
	- Location code
	- Date (`MM-DD`)
	- Fly number
	- Trap number
	- Tissue code (Something like: M, S, C, H ~ Midgut, Salivary glands, Carcass, Head)

- A label must be written for each tube that a fly will be packed into.
	- If you are collecting carcass and midguts: two labels with the above information will be generated for each fly and given to __Packaging__.


- Periodically, the labels are sent to the __Packaging__ station(s) for application to the tubes.


_Remarks:_

- The sooner that __Packaging__ gets these labels, the faster the whole process will go and the less likely it will be that flies become mislabeled.


###########################################################
### Dissection station ###

<!-- _Inputs:_

- slides with incapacitated fly and labeled with fly number

_Outputs:_

- to __Infection detection__:
	- labeled slides with dissected fly and tissues  -->

_For each fly:_

1. __Wash tools (forceps/scissors/etc) in 90% EtOH and wipe with Kim-Wipes to avoid contamination of current fly.__
1. Dissect according to the needs of the collection trip.
1. Organize tissues on the slide in PBS so as to best facilitate the inspection for positives in next station.
1. Send slide to __Infection status__.


_Remarks:_

- Avoid cross contaminating flies with Trypanosomes by frequent and thorough cleaning of your forceps etc.

###########################################################
### Infection detection station ###

<!-- _Inputs:_

- labeled slides with dissected fly and tissues 

_Outputs:_

- to __Packaging__:
	- labeled slides with dissected fly and tissues
	- infection status -->

_For each fly:_

1. __Wash tools (forceps/scissors/etc) in 90% EtOH and wipe with Kim-Wipes to avoid contamination of current fly.__
1. Examine tissues for signs of Trypanosome infection.
1. Call out the infection status for __Labeling__ and __Packaging__.
	- in practice calling out only the status of flies that are positive is sufficient.
	- if you are able to distinguish between low, medium, and high levels of infection, it is good to do so.
1. Pass slide to __Packaging__.


_Remarks:_

- Avoid cross contaminating flies with Trypanosomes by frequent and thorough cleaning of your forceps etc.

###########################################################
### Packaging station ###

<!-- _Inputs:_

-

_Outputs:_

- -->


_For each fly:_

1. __Wash tools (forceps/scissors/etc) in 90% EtOH and wipe with Kim-Wipes to avoid contamination of current fly.__
1. Assemble enough tubes (_pre-filled with ~250ul of 90% EtOH or appropriate storage solution_) to receive the number of separate tissues dictated by the needs of this collection.
1. If possible, use the labels generated by __Labeling__ to pre-label the tubes to reduce confusion.
1. Package the tissues in correctly labeled tubes as swiftly as possible _while maintaining control of quality_.
1. __Double-check__ that each tube has the correct side-label, then label the tube top with _only_ the Site-ID code and fly number using lab marker/sharpie.
1. If the fly has a positive status, add a code to the side-label:
	- `'+'` = low to normal infection level
	- `'++'` = mid to high infection
	- `'+++'` = very high infection

_After the live flies have been processed:_

1. All teneral^[An adult too young to have bloodfed.] flies: live or dead are placed into communal falcon tubes by Village (or approximately synonymous site level).
	- males and females can be combined
1. Dead non-teneral flies are separated by sex and placed into communal falcon tubes by Village.
1. Communal tubes are labeled with information analogous to individual flies except that there is no fly number and the number of flies contained in each falcon tube is included.
1. Add enough 90% EtOH to cover the flies sufficiently, allowing for some extra.
1. This information should match the info recorded in the field data sheets.

_Remarks:_

- Avoid cross contaminating flies with Trypanosomes by frequent and thorough cleaning of your forceps etc.
- Pre-filling hundreds of tubes with ~250ul of EtOH the night before will save you __enormous__ time and pain during the processing sessions and reduce the likelihood of mistakes.


###########################################################
### Tube sealing station ###

<!-- _Inputs:_

- packaged and labeled tissue tubes
- parafilm

_Outputs:_

- Tubes sealed with parafilm to prevent leakage of storage solution during transport. -->

1. Get a strip of parafilm with dimensions  approximately 2 inches long/~0.5 inches wide (~5cm Long /~1.5cm Wide).
1. Stretch it about 1.5 times around the tube where the label is affixed.
1. Break it off.
1. Stretch the rest around the seam where the top meets the tube: make sure that it covers the writing on the tube top AND seals the seam.
1. Organize the tubes in boxes or bags with a system similar to the following:
	- tubes of the same tissue type are stored together with other tubes with the same site-code (~Village level)
	- Bags/boxes above can be placed into larger bags that group a particular ~village etc.


_Remarks:_

- _Use this opportunity to double-check that the side-labels of each tube match the tube-tops._
- This step is best done __by everyone__ following the completion of the main processing queue.
- Doing this on the same day as the processing of the tubes is best.
- If the tubes are to be transported by plane/bus/over-seas, the quality of this step may be considered directly proportional to the ability of the tubes to be used correctly in the lab and therefore to the quality of results possible.

# Milking Traps #

## Materials ##

- See materials list for Trap Deploying.

## Procedures ##

- The teams may be 2-3 people.
- Multiple teams per location may operate simultaneously to speed recovery of trap cages.
- Each team should have pencil and paper to place a labeled piece of paper^[Should contain the new date and same trap number.] in the new trap cage that they use to replace the retrieved trap cage for each trap.
- Retrieved trap cages should be handled in such a way to reduce the death rate before processing can be begun.
	- shade
	- avoid excessive temps
	- out of access from ants etc.
