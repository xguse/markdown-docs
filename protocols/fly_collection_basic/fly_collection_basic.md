# Deploying Traps #

## Materials ##
- gum boots

### Per Trap ###
- 1 metal rod
- 1 biconical fabric trap
- 1 collection cage and net sleeve
- thick grease
- ~2 rubber bands

## Team ##
Deployment teams generally consist of 2 to 5 people.
Gear is divided among the team as works best but there are usually a couple common classes of job.

Record Keeper

:	carries the GPS device, a pencil, a pad of paper.

Panga

:	Carries the panga and hammer.

General Purpose

:	carries what is needed. Some combination of trap materials as needed including trap cones, collection cages/nets, grease, rubber bands.

## Procedures ##
- As the team travels in the deployment area conducive sites are identified.
- The __Record Keeper__ places the date and trap number into the collection cage; records the trap's GPS coordinates __in DECIMAL DEGREES__ format to 5 decimal places; and makes notes about the type of surrounding habitat as well as human activity in sight of the trap.
- The site is cleared by the __Panga__ and the rod is driven into the ground deep enough to provide robust "staying power".
- The fabric cone is sliped onto the rod and the bottom is secured with a rubber band.
- the tagged cage is added to the top and secured with a rubber band.
- a __generous__ amount of thick grease is applied to the rod below the cone such that the safari ants will be denied access to the trap cone and collection cage.
