## Org Marketing Statement ##

All over the world, Pfizer colleagues are working together to positively impact health for everyone, everywhere.
Each position at Pfizer touches and contributes to the success of our business and our world.
That’s why, as one of the global leaders in the biopharmaceutical industry, Pfizer is committed to seeking out inspired new talent who share our core values and mission of making the world a healthier place.

## Role Description ##

As part of the Computational Sciences Center of Emphasis, apply and possibly develop advanced analysis and mining approaches to
inform target / biomarker identification and compound selection.
The successful candidate will be responsible for performing __integrative analysis__ relating molecular entities, in-vitro/in-vivo/clinical biological activities, and complex phenotypes in a quantitative way and 
deliver testable hypotheses in high quality presentations/publications.
The ideal candidate will have 
demonstrated expertise with data mining methods upon large-scale, multidimensional molecular datasets, and 
possess expertise in mining structured data and unstructured/text information and be able to 
identify gaps in current methodologies and define requirements for solutions to address these gaps.

## Responsibilities ##

- Perform computational analysis efforts of high-dimensional datasets from  model systems, experimental medicine and clinical trials to identify novel targets, biomarkers, mechanisms of resistance, and effective therapeutic combinations through the translation of bioinformatics data. 
- Deliver testable hypotheses/insights from complex multidimenstional data to inform target/compound selection, biomarker identification and patient stratification in high quality presentations & publications. 
- Identify and validate innovative approaches to improve quality and efficiency of hypothesis generation from experimental data  
- Maintain current awareness of emerging approaches and methods in computational biology and provide ad-hoc support to cross-disciplinary project teams.


## Qualifications ##

Education and Experience: 
PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Biological Sciences, relevant natural sciences required, 
1-2 years relevant experience applying quatitative approaches to solving biological problems, ideally in a pharmaceutical, biotech or comparable context. 

## Technical Skills:  ##
- Demonstrated expertise in delivering insights/hypotheses from complex multi-dimensional biological data in a biomedical context. 
- Demonstrated experience applying, defining and validating computational approaches to deliver insights/hypotheses, e_g_ multivariate, Bayesian and machine learning approaches. 
- Pharmaceutically relevant experience or formal training in computational chemistry/biology, computer science, physics, applied mathematics, or statistics 
- Demonstrated ability for sound experimental design for in-silico experimentation/workflows required, in addition to ability to effectively interface with Research Unit biologist to communicate/discuss  results, ideas, and follow-up experiments. 
- In depth knowledge of relevant public and proprietary databases, methods and tools. 
- Exceptional communication skills (oral and written) as demonstrated by publications & presentations.
