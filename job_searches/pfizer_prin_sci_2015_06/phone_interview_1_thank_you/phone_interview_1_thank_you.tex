\section{Letter body}\label{letter-body}

Dear Dr.~Brockel:

I wanted to thank you regarding our phone conversation yesterday. I
would like to reiterate my considerable interest in this position and
thank you for answering my questions. As I move forward with my career,
I am passionate about returning to gene expression, but I have also
learned that I enjoy working with population genetics. So I was pleased
to confirm that this post would likely include projects involving both
approaches. Additionally, I love the process of collaborating with
colleagues, discussing their data/research goals, assisting in
experimental design, then allowing them to see their results in a new
light with deeper insights, and I feel very strongly that it is a
process for which I have developed the right tools to do well.

We discussed briefly my work using Bayesian methods to learn the shape
parameters of the Beta-modeled, bin-wise, linkage disequilibrium
distributions, but we were swiftly running out of time. I have attached
here a more detailed description of the process in case you would like
to see a bit more of the particulars. I have also begun to adapt some of
my earlier code that down-sampled a set of SNPs located on the human
chromosome 22 to apply to the \emph{Drosophila melanogaster} genetic
reference panel data to better characterize the performance of my
process in a more data-rich dipteran system.

Finally, as I am particularly interested in this position, I would like
to ensure that you get any information that you may find useful as you
evaluate my candidacy and goodness-of-fit. If you would like \emph{any}
further information/references, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I look forward to hearing from you next week, and thank you again for
taking the time to call.

Yours respectfully,

Gus Dunn
