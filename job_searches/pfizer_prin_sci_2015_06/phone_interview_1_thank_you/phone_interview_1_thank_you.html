<p>Dear Dr.Â Brockel:</p>
<p>I wanted to thank you regarding our phone conversation yesterday. I would like to reiterate my considerable interest in this position and thank you for answering my questions. As I move forward with my career, I am passionate about returning to gene expression, but I have also learned that I enjoy working with population genetics. So I was pleased to confirm that this post would likely include projects involving both approaches. Additionally, I love the process of collaborating with colleagues, discussing their data/research goals, assisting in experimental design, then allowing them to see their results in a new light with deeper insights, and I feel very strongly that it is a process for which I have developed the right tools to do well.</p>
<p>We discussed briefly my work using Bayesian methods to learn the shape parameters of the Beta-modeled, bin-wise, linkage disequilibrium distributions, but we were swiftly running out of time. I have attached here a more detailed description of the process in case you would like to see a bit more of the particulars. I have also begun to adapt some of my earlier code that down-sampled a set of SNPs located on the human chromosome 22 to apply to the <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> genetic reference panel data to better characterize the performance of my process in a more data-rich dipteran system.</p>
<p>Finally, as I am particularly interested in this position, I would like to ensure that you get any information that you may find useful as you evaluate my candidacy and goodness-of-fit. If you would like <em>any</em> further information/references, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you next week, and thank you again for taking the time to call.</p>
<p>Yours respectfully,</p>
<p>Gus Dunn</p>
