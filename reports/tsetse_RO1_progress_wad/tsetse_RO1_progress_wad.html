<h1 id="Sampling">Sampling</h1>
<h2 id="study-sites">Study sites</h2>
<p>The surveys were done in the districts of Kole, Oyam, Nwoya, Amuru, Adjumani, Moyo and Arua in northern/Northwest Uganda. Additional information on tsetse population distribution was obtained from the District Entomology Offices of the relevant districts.</p>
<h2 id="data-collection">Data collection</h2>
<p>Trapping for tsetse flies were carried out using biconicals traps <span class="citation">(<span>Challier, A and Laveissiere</span> 1973)</span>. The coordinates for each trap site were taken using a hand-held GPS. Vegetation types and human activities at the trapping sites were also recorded. Each village is at least 5km apart; a single village is taken to be a trapping site (with a number of traps deployed in each).</p>
<h2 id="dissection-and-examination">Dissection and examination</h2>
<p>Trapped flies were identified, sexed, counted, recorded and transported to a field dissection site. Live flies were dissected and examined microscopically to determine the presence/absence of trypanosomes in the midguts/salivary glands. The midguts, fly carcass, reproductive parts, and heads were then preserved in parafilm-sealed and labeled cryo-tubes in either 90% ethanol or RNA-preservation solution for further molecular studies.</p>

<p>Five villages were surveyed (Olepo [OLE], Mwanya [MWA], Akayo-debe [AKA], Aputu-Lwaa [APU], and Ocala [OCA]) with a total of 40 traps. 1227 <em>Gff</em> were captured (564 M and 663 F) and yielded five infected individuals (1.2% estimated infection rate).</p>
<h2 id="oyam-district-2014-05-17-to-2014-05-22">Oyam District (<code>2014-05-17 to 2014-05-22</code>)</h2>
<p>Nine villages were surveyed (Ocala [OCA], Odworo [OD], Alege [ALE], Acankoma [ACA], Oguk [OGU], Agoba B [AG], Abok[ABO], Ocol [OCL] and Opuyu [OPU]) with 32 traps. 715 <em>Gff</em> were captured (298 M and 417 F) and yielded 10 infected individuals (3.0% estimated infection rate).</p>
<h2 id="oyam-and-kole-districts-2014-07-14-to-2014-07-21">Oyam and Kole Districts (<code>2014-07-14 to 2014-07-21</code>)</h2>
<p>This survey targeted sites that produced infected flies from the previous surveys. The field team deployed 27 traps across four villages that were divided between the two districts:</p>
<p><strong>Oyam:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ocala [OCA]</li>
<li>Odworo [OD]</li>
<li>Acankoma [ACA]</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Kole:</strong></p>

<li>Akayodebe [AKA]</li>
