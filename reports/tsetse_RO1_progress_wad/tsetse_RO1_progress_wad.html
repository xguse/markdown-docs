<h1 id="specimen-database">1: Specimen database</h1>
<p>A multitude of data is associated with each fly collected. The type of information includes the list of tissues collected, the collection date, village name and location, sex, species, trap number, infection status, notes on human activity surrounding the trap, and more. All of this information needs to remain tied to all specimens, materials, and <em>data</em> derived from these as the project goes forward.</p>
<p>We are designing and implementing a custom database and web application to manage, track, and facilitate analysis of the thousands of specimen tubes associated with this project that will be generated and exist already. The system consists of a web-based user interface, two SQL-based relational databases, and a layer of custom python functions that connect the two. The web-based interface uses the open-source <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> web interface components. One SQL database will act as the official storage system for the specimen data, while the second will manage checkout requests by our researchers and update the main storage database upon validation. The custom python code is based on the open-source <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask">Flask</a> web-microframework. This code manages the two databases according to requests made through the web-interface. It also manages user registration and permissions along with site-security. Finally, it will also allow us to easily design and run complex analyses with the specimen data encoded in the main database.</p>
<h1 id="collections-overview">2: Collections Overview</h1>
<h2 id="study-sites">2.1: Study sites</h2>
<p>The surveys were done in the Ugandan districts of Kole, Oyam, Nwoya, Amuru, Adjumani, Moyo, Arua, Kitgum, Lamwo, and Pader. Additional information on tsetse population distribution was obtained from the District Entomology Offices of the relevant districts.</p>
<h2 id="data-collection">2.2: Data collection</h2>
<p>Trapping for tsetse flies were carried out using biconicals traps <span class="citation">(<span>Challier, A and Laveissiere</span> 1973)</span>. The coordinates for each trap site were taken using a hand-held GPS. Vegetation types and human activities at the trapping sites were also recorded. Each village is at least 5km apart; a single village is taken to be a trapping site (with a number of traps deployed in each).</p>
<h2 id="dissection-and-examination">2.3: Dissection and examination</h2>
<p>Trapped flies were identified, sexed, counted, recorded and transported to a field dissection site. Live flies were dissected and examined microscopically to determine the presence/absence of trypanosomes in the midguts/salivary glands. The midguts, fly carcass, reproductive parts, and heads were then preserved in parafilm-sealed and labeled cryo-tubes in either 90% ethanol or RNA-preservation solution for further molecular studies.</p>
