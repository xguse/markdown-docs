# Sampling {#Sampling}
## Study sites
The surveys were done in the districts of Kole, Oyam, Nwoya, Amuru, Adjumani, Moyo and Arua in northern/Northwest Uganda. Additional information on tsetse population distribution was obtained from the District Entomology Offices of the relevant districts. 

## Data collection
Trapping for tsetse flies were carried out using biconicals traps [@ChallierAandLaveissiere1973].
The coordinates for each trap site were taken using a hand-held GPS.
Vegetation types and human activities at the trapping sites were also recorded.
Each village is at least 5km apart; a single village is taken to be a trapping site (with a number of traps deployed in each).

## Dissection and examination
Trapped flies were identified, sexed, counted, recorded and transported to a field dissection site.
Live flies were dissected and examined microscopically to determine the presence/absence of trypanosomes in the midguts/salivary glands.
The midguts, fly carcass, reproductive parts, and heads were then preserved in parafilm-sealed and labeled cryo-tubes in either 90% ethanol or RNA-preservation solution for further molecular studies.

# Results 

## Kole District (`2014-03-22 to 2014-03-30`)

Five villages were surveyed (Olepo [OLE], Mwanya [MWA], Akayo-debe [AKA], Aputu-Lwaa [APU], and Ocala [OCA]) with a total of 40 traps.
1227 _Gff_ were captured (564 M and 663 F) and yielded five infected individuals (1.2% estimated infection rate).


## Oyam District (`2014-05-17 to 2014-05-22`)

Nine villages were surveyed (Ocala [OCA], Odworo [OD], Alege [ALE], Acankoma [ACA], Oguk [OGU], Agoba B [AG], Abok[ABO], Ocol [OCL] and Opuyu [OPU]) with 32 traps.
715 _Gff_ were captured (298 M and 417 F) and yielded 10 infected individuals (3.0% estimated infection rate).


## Oyam and Kole Districts (`2014-07-14 to 2014-07-21`)

This survey targeted sites that produced infected flies from the previous surveys.
The field team deployed 27 traps across four villages that were divided between the two districts: 

__Oyam:__

- Ocala [OCA]
- Odworo [OD]
- Acankoma [ACA]

__Kole:__

- Akayodebe [AKA]
