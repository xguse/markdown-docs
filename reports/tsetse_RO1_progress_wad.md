# Sampling {#Sampling}
## Study sites
The surveys were done in the districts of Kole, Oyam, Oyam-Kole2, Nwoya, Amuru, Adjumani, Moyo and Arua districts in northern/Northwest Uganda. Secondary data on tsetse population distribution were obtained from the District Entomology Offices of the relevant districts. 

## Data collection
Trapping for tsetse flies were carried out using biconicals traps [[@ChallierAandLaveissiere1973]].
The coordinates for each trap site was taken using a handheld GPS.
Vegetation types and human activities at the trapping sites were also recorded.
Each village is at least 5km apart; a single village herein is taken to be a trapping site (with a number of traps deployed in each).

## Dissection and examination
Trapped flies were identified, sexed, counted, recorded and transported to a field dissection site and live ones dissected microscopically to determine presence/absence of trypanosomes.
The dissection was done following standard protocols, and the midgut/salivary glands examined for presence of trypanosomes by microscopic assessment.
The midguts, whole fly, reproductive parts and heads were then preserved in parafilm-sealed and properly labeled cryo-tubes in either 90% ethanol or RNA-preservation solution for further molecular studies.
